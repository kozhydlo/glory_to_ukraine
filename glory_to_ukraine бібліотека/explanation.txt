You can save the above code to a file named glory.py. Then, you can import the glory_to_ukraine() function from the file and call it in your program as shown below


As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to create software or libraries directly, but I can give you guidance on how to create a library that outputs "Glory to Ukraine" in various programming languages.

Here's an example of how you can create a library that outputs "Glory to Ukraine" in Python:

python
Copy code
def glory_to_ukraine():
    print("Glory to Ukraine!")
You can save the above code to a file named glory.py. Then, you can import the glory_to_ukraine() function from the file and call it in your program as shown below:

python
Copy code
from glory import glory_to_ukraine

glory_to_ukraine()
When you run the above code, it will output "Glory to Ukraine!".

You can create similar libraries in other programming languages as well. The syntax may vary depending on the language, but the basic idea is to define a function that outputs the desired text and then call that function in your program.
